# 🚗 Accident Detection and Alert System

This project is an **Accident Detection and Alert System** built using **Arduino Uno**. The system detects accidents and sends alerts to emergency contacts, ensuring rapid response and safety.

## 🛠️ Features
- 📡 **Accident Detection** – Uses sensors (e.g., accelerometer, vibration sensor) to detect crashes.
- 📍 **Location Tracking** – Sends GPS coordinates in case of an accident.
- 📞 **Alert System** – Sends SMS notifications to emergency contacts.
- 🔋 **Low Power Consumption** – Optimized for minimal energy use.
- 🔧 **Easy Integration** – Can be integrated with IoT platforms for remote monitoring.

## 🏗️ Hardware Requirements
- **Arduino Uno**
- **Accelerometer Sensor (e.g., ADXL335)**
- **Vibration Sensor**
- **GPS Module (e.g., Neo-6M)**
- **GSM Module (e.g., SIM800L)**
- **Buzzer**
- **LEDs**
- **Power Supply (Battery/Adapter)**

## 🖥️ Software Requirements
- **Arduino IDE**
- **Embedded C / C++**
- **Libraries**:
  - `SoftwareSerial.h` (for GSM module communication)
  - `TinyGPS++.h` (for GPS data processing)

## 🔄 Working Principle
1. Sensors continuously monitor the vehicle's motion.
2. If an accident is detected (via sudden impact/vibration changes), the system triggers an alert.
3. The **GPS module** fetches the location data.
4. The **GSM module** sends an emergency message with location details.
5. A **buzzer and LED** are activated to signal the accident.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Connect all components** as per the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload the code** to the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.
3. Insert a **SIM card** into the GSM module.
4. Power up the system and **test it** by simulating an accident.
5. Upon detection, the system **automatically sends alerts**.
